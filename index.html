                <p>I am Omar, a Palestinian student studying in Hungary in the field of

                    also called (NYE University) in the Faculty of Informatics and Mathematics.
                    I am an ambitious person who strives for the top in any work I do. I am distinguished in my 
                    studies and ranked among the top three. I respect my teachers and are loyal to my university. 
                    I try to convey a beautiful picture of my country, Palestine, and the Palestinians, as 
                    I am the only Palestinian student there.  I work as a software developer in general and in particular, 
                    specializing in two areas: web development, problem solving and data 
                    structure, as well as integrated database design. <a href="cv/cv.pdf"> see my cv</a></p>

                        <h3>Copy of Academic Transcript</h3>
                        <p>Since I entered the university, I have been keen to keep my academic average high in all subjects,
                             even though I study in Hungarian.  The scholarship requests only 36 credits in each of the two 
                             contiguous semesters.  I faced the difficulties of the first chapter, but in the second chapter 
                             things are going well on the way to the top, and this is <a href="file/transcript.pdf">Copy of Academic Transcript</a> explains that.  
                             The material for this class is not all scored on Neptune yet but I got high marks on it as well as 
                             the others.

                        <h3>Letter of Recommendation</h3>
                        <p>I always strive to obtain the satisfaction of my teachers and do all the required jobs to the fullest and as required.  The teachers praise and respect 
                            me very much because I am a diligent student and distinguished in lectures.  This is a  <a href="file/Letter of recommendation.pdf">letter of recommendation </a> from data base prof and this another <a href="file/SKM_C257i23060510570.pdf">letter of recommendation</a> one from data structure professor.

                        <h3>Creative Works or Projects</h3>
                        <p>Since I was a first-year student, there were not many projects that were implemented 
                            because the study materials focus mainly on construction and mathematics subjects: 
                            data structure, data bases, as well as discrete mathematics and linear algebra.  
                            However, in general, I am keen on making projects to fill out the portfolio and 
                            personal exhibition of works, and one of these projects is the <a href="https://se-bayan-elian.github.io/App-Market/?#">App Market</a> website 
                            that I implemented in partnership with my friend, as it is an interface 
                            for an online store (click on the name to view) and I also designed this website 
                            (<a href="#">NYE-BOY</a>) by myself to display my files for a better form and express mysel.

                        <p>An active member of the university as an international student, I am keen to participate 
                            in all university cultural events and activities, to be keen to convey a good image that 
                            represents the Palestinian student in general, and I demanded in my capacity as the first 
                            Palestinian student studying at the university to always raise the <a href="file/flag.pdf">flag of Palestine</a> on all
